# Auto-encoders to build an embeddings space for an individual across multi-tissue RNA-seq samples 

- [x] Basic data pre-processing
- [x] Data loading in torch
- [ ] Set up basic autoencoder
- [ ] Set up basic prediction environment
- [ ] Pre-processing with batch effects
- [ ] Upgraded prediction environment with batch effects removed
- [ ] Transfer learning using other tissues
